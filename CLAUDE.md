# MonitorAgent

> **Keep this file in sync with every change.** When modifying architecture, schema, UI layout, data sources, or project structure, update the relevant section here first.

macOS menu bar app that displays usage statistics for Claude Code and Codex.

## Stack

- Swift 5.10 / SwiftUI + AppKit / macOS 14+
- SQLite via GRDB (Swift Package Manager)
- Build: `swift build`
- Test: `swift test`
- Release build: `swift build -c release`
- Run locally: `swift run MonitorAgent &`
- Stop locally: `pkill -f MonitorAgent`

## Data Source

Self-owned JSONL parsing, no third-party dependency.

| Source | Path | Parser |
|--------|------|--------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | `ClaudeLogParser` — extracts `message.usage` from `type == "assistant"` lines |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` + `~/.codex/archived_sessions/rollout-*.jsonl` | `CodexLogParser` — stateful, extracts `token_count` events with heartbeat dedup and stores uncached input tokens |

Database: `~/.monitor-agent/monitor.db`

The database is a derived local cache, not the source of truth. Database open failures keep the app available so the rebuild action remains accessible. `Settings > General > Data` can rebuild the cache by syncing all Claude Code and Codex JSONL logs into `~/.monitor-agent/monitor-rebuild.tmp.db`, validating that temporary database, then replacing `monitor.db` only after the rebuild succeeds. If the active database contains data but no source files can be read, the rebuild aborts without replacing it. The rebuild runs in a sheet that shows file-level progress and the final requests/sessions/files summary. Original Claude/Codex logs and settings are never modified. Any leftover temporary rebuild database is cleaned up on app startup.

Incremental sync resets a file's parser state when the source file is truncated or replaced with a smaller file. Parsed records and the matching `sync_state` offset are committed in one database transaction so an offset never advances past records that failed to persist. Rebuild waits for the sync queue to become idle, and database reads, writes, close, reopen, and replacement share one lifecycle lock so the active database cannot be replaced during an in-flight operation.

## UI Layout

**Menu Bar**: Robot icon (template image from bundled SVG). Left-click opens the panel and triggers an on-demand sync. Right-click opens About / General / Config / Prompt / Check for Updates / Quit. Update-check dialogs use a SwiftUI-hosted panel with structured states for checking, up-to-date, new version, downloading, installing, completion, and failure. New-version dialogs show current build metadata and scrollable release notes; downloads show determinate MB progress. Updates are extracted into a staging directory, validated as a MonitorAgent app bundle, and only then replace the installed app. Activation policy is `.accessory` (no Dock icon). Re-clicking the app icon shows the panel via `applicationShouldHandleReopen`.

**Panel** (top → bottom):

1. **FilterBar** — `[All | Claude Code | Codex]` segmented control plus right-aligned date range dropdown. Presets are `Today | 7 Days | 30 Days | All Time`; the calendar supports single-day and start/end range selection. Selecting the current day from the calendar uses the dynamic `Today` range instead of a fixed custom date, and any active date selection resets to `Today` after day rollover.
2. **StatCards** — `Requests | Sessions | Tokens | Cache Hit`. Requests, Sessions, and Cache Hit share a metric-card width; Tokens is wider. Requests and Sessions show exact grouped counts with single-line scaling. Tokens is a composite card whose total is Input Tokens + Output Tokens + Cache Read + Cache Creation; abbreviated token values use two decimal places, and hover/click detail shows each token category. Cache Hit shows the percentage.
3. **Activity** — GitHub-style heatmap with `Default` trailing-365-day mode and per-year mode. Month labels use a fixed single-line overlay aligned to the heatmap grid, with the final label clamped inside the trailing edge so opening the hourly chart cannot shift or truncate the labels. Hover shows the daily request count with the tooltip kept inside the heatmap width. Days with no activity are not selectable. Clicking an active day filters the whole panel to that date and opens a fixed-height hourly token chart for Input Tokens, Output Tokens, Cache Read, Cache Creation, and request count when token data exists; clicking the current day uses the dynamic `Today` range. The chart x-axis shows 3-hour labels from `0h` through `21h`; today's chart stops drawing at the current hour so future zero-value buckets do not pull lines down. Hovering inside the chart shows the nearest start-inclusive one-hour range plus its exact request count and token values. Clicking outside Activity hides the chart without restoring the previous date range; switching All / Claude Code / Codex keeps the chart open when data remains available.
4. **ModelDistribution** — stacked proportion bar plus three-column legend for top models. Known model aliases retain their established colors; new model names receive deterministic, collision-aware colors from an extensible palette instead of sharing a generic fallback color.

**About** — App icon (`AppIcon.icns`), name, tagline, bundle version plus release commit SHA from `AppVersion.versionWithCommit`, optional release date from `AppVersion.releaseDate`, GitHub button.

**Settings** — Left sidebar (General / Config / Prompt) plus right content area. Cancel closes the window. Save asks for confirmation before applying the current category, then keeps the window open and shows a top green success toast. Save only applies to the current category. Switching categories reloads from disk. Config/Prompt use a Claude Code / Codex tab bar.

- **General** — Theme (System/Light/Dark), Sync Interval (10s/30s/60s/Never), Keep in Background toggle, Launch at Login toggle, Data rebuild action with progress/result sheet
- **Config** — TextEditor for `~/.claude/settings.json` (JSON validated on save) and `~/.codex/config.toml`; shows "File not found" if missing
- **Prompt** — TextEditor for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; shows "File not found" if missing

## Branches

- `develop` — active development, all work here
- `main` — release only, merged from develop at release time

## Release

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for full workflow. Summary:
1. Agent: verify → move `[Unreleased]` entries → commit → tag on `develop`
2. You: push `develop` + tags, create PR, merge `develop` into `main`
3. GitHub Actions: release only after `main` receives a reachable unreleased tag

## Conventions

- Git commit: one short English sentence
- Code comments: English only
- Update CHANGELOG.md `[Unreleased]` section with every code change
- Update this file when architecture, schema, UI layout, or project structure changes
- Do not call a release published until the tagged commit is on `main` and the GitHub Release workflow completes
